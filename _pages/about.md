Hey, thanks for visiting my website!

I'm Warren, a Junior pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm also working as a Research Assistant under [Professor Gowtham Kaki](https://gowthamk.github.io/) in the [CU PLV lab](https://plv.colorado.edu/) - A lab which focuses on "Expressivity, Performance, Dependability, and Understanding of Computational Systems". 

I've completed all my major coursework with a 4.0 GPA, gaining a solid foundation in algorithms, AI, machine learning, and software engineering.

Outside of school, I'm also passionate about creating innovative side projects, from tools like Capitol Gains for tracking house members' (Pelosi's) stock trades and an AI-powered stock charting app, to an app which converts data into watchable and redownloadable youtube videos, exploiting the lack of a file upload limit on YouTube. I enjoy blending tech with finance, crafting solutions for investors, and learning through my attempts to build anything I'm interested in. Outside of coding, I also enjoy building things with my hands, weightlifting, and playing competitive games such as League, Valorant, and Counter Strike.
